## Getting Started

Begin by forking the repository located at the following url:

`https://github.com/compTAG/t4ds`

The site is built using Jekyll, hosted by github pages. If you'd like to build the
site locally, it should work by installing Jekyll, and running
`bundle exec jekyll serve`. Often Jekyll can be a bit tricky to get installed and
working properly, so if you don't want to spend the effort it should be fine to just 
build live as well. Do so by pushing to the `gh-pages` branch. After doing so, the 
site should built automatically in a couple minutes.

## Working in the T4DS Repository

For stylistic changes throughout the site, one can customize features either in
`_config.yml` for primary site themes, headings and features, or in the html files
located in `_layouts`.

To update the workshop materials themselves, edit the markdown files located in
`_posts`. (Or, create your own new markdown files!)
