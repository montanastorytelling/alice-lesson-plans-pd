### Land Acknowledgement

We acknowledge that Montana State University and the schools we work with are on the ancestral lands of American Indians, past and present. Through our work with Montana middle school students and their teachers, we hope to honor and respect the twelve tribal nations that call Montana home today, and we draw inspiration from the stories of these communities whose oral histories embody this land.

## Why CS in YOUR Classroom?

### Given:
* 1000 open CS jobs in Montana; average salary 68k
* Only 148 CS graduates in Montana in 2019
* Only 37% of public high schools teach foundational CS

### It is clear that:
* We need more CS in Montana
* Early exposure is important

### Rethinking CS:
* CS is necessary for all future citizens
* Computing can be integrated into everyday life
* CS can be integrated into every classroom
* Computing is a form of self-expression and problem solving
