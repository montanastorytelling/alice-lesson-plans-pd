### Land Acknowledgement

We acknowledge that Montana State University and the schools we work with are on the ancestral lands of American Indians, past and present. Through our work with Montana middle school students and their teachers, we hope to honor and respect the twelve tribal nations that call Montana home today, and we draw inspiration from the stories of these communities whose oral histories embody this land.
