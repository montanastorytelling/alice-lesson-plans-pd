              <p class="lead">This curriculum is designed for grades 4-6. Using
              the Arduino Circuit Playground, LEDs, copper tape, and sensors,
              students tell their own stories in a visual narrative style inspired
              by Montana tribal ledger art. Computer science concepts are learned as a means
              of personalizing projects, engaging and inspiring students who
              otherwise might not see themselves as computer scientists. Lessons
              in the curriculum reference computer science standards, the Indian
              Education for All Act Essential Understandings, as well as math,
              science, social studies, English language arts, and visual arts standards.
              This curriculum can be integrated into any teacher's classroom.</p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Broadening Participation</h3>
            <p>Our lessons use physical computing with textiles that are embedded with
              electronics and then programmed by students. Because many teachers and
              students believe that computing is difficult, these novel approaches enable
              more broad access to computer science. They have been shown to not only engage
              students and teachers in rigorous computing, but also to make computing fun.

            <p>We acknowledge that Montana State University and the schools we work with
                are on the ancestral lands of American Indians, including the A’aninin
                (Gros Ventre), Amskapi/Piikani (Blackfeet), Annishinabe (Chippewa/Ojibway),
                Annishinabe/Métis (Little Shell Chippewa), Apsáalooke (Crow), Ktunaxa/Ksanka
                (Kootenai), Lakota, Dakota (Sioux), Nakoda (Assiniboine), Ne-i-yah-wahk
                (Plains Cree), Qíispé (Pend d’Oreille), Seliš (Salish), and Tsétsêhéstâhese/So’taahe
                (Northern Cheyenne). Through our work with Montana students and teachers, we honor
                and respect these twelve tribal nations that call Montana home today, by drawing
                inspiration from the stories of these communities whose oral histories embody this land.
