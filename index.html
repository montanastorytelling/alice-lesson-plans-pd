            <p class="lead">
                The storytelling project spans five departments at Montana State University, and involves undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, postdoctoral researchers, staff, and K-12 teachers throughout Montana. Our objective is to expose middle school students to basic computer science, and increase the accessibility of computer science throughout Montana.<br>

            <h3 class="text-center">Broadening Participation</h3>
            <p>Our lessons use physical computing with textiles that are embedded with
              electronics and then programmed by students. Because many teachers and
              students believe that computing is difficult, these novel approaches enable
              more broad access to computer science. They have been shown to not only engage
              students and teachers in rigorous computing, but also to make computing fun.

            <p>
                We acknowledge that Montana State University and the schools we work with
                are on the ancestral lands of American Indians, including the A’aninin
                (Gros Ventre), Amskapi/Piikani (Blackfeet), Annishinabe (Chippewa/Ojibway),
                Annishinabe/Métis (Little Shell Chippewa), Apsáalooke (Crow), Ktunaxa/Ksanka
                (Kootenai), Lakota, Dakota (Sioux), Nakoda (Assiniboine), Ne-i-yah-wahk
                (Plains Cree), Qíispé (Pend d’Oreille), Seliš (Salish), and Tsétsêhéstâhese/So’taahe
                (Northern Cheyenne). Through our work with Montana students and teachers, we honor
                and respect these twelve tribal nations that call Montana home today, by drawing
                inspiration from the stories of these communities whose oral histories embody this land.
