* What information was most interesting?​
* What was most surprising?

---

* Objects, Object Methods, and World Preview
* Push play
* Inspect the code
* Discuss as a class how the computer interprets the code

## Day One: Explore

## Day Two: Group discussion

1. Stories are a part of theory and are a legitimate sources of data.
2. Women in the tribes of the Columbia plateau made beaded bags.
3. The size of the bead can help date the beadwork, with pony (large) beads being from the early 1800s, and smaller beads introduces in mid-1800s.
4. Recall the scene in the beadbag that we will animate today.
5. Discuss as a class how the computer interprets the code

## Day Two: Animate

## Day Two: Share

* Ask the students to share their animation, the story they are telling
* What methods did they use to accomplish their animation (this can be done by projecting to the classroom, having all students huddle around, or just verbal descriptions).
* Ask non-presenting students to describe what the differences were between the two stories.
